# Throwback
A library of older shows and archived footage, consolidated into one platform.

## Planned Support
* Discord (Desktop, Mobile)
* Browser Support
* Desktop App (Windows, Linux)
* Mobile App (iOS, Android)

## What This Is:
Throwback is a compiled library of links to archived footage and assets, compiled from different sources around the internet, pertaining to older shows, cartoons, and other forms of entertainment. We aren't hosting any of the content or static files ourselves, only acting as an intermediary.

We do so by using the United States' (Our Jurisdiction) Digital Millenium Copyright Act's Section 108 (Citing Precedent: 'The Internet Archive' and subsequent "Wayback Machine.'). In consideration of that, we're not doing this to be of a commercial nature, and are ensuring that the project remains open-source and available to all for both research and archival purposes.

## What This Is Not:
This is not a hosted location where we're storing isolated copies of each video or protected work, in their entirety. This also isn't meant to be a monetized platform to compete with other standing streaming services. This isn't a project designed to confuse or deter people from the original companies or weaken trademark identities or accompanying intended fortification.

## Isn't This Piracy?
No, for a few reasons. First, even if we were storing one copy of each work, there are specific sections in the DMCA that were created to allow for doing so, as well as established precedent thus far. Second, there's no set definition of 'Piracy.' Technically, it's a slanderous term as it doesn't equate to isolated duplication of assets (what people try to use it for), as that obviously doesn't equate to theft or removal of the source material, as is the intended correlation to the term(s) used for privateers on the old "high seas." Third, we don't actually host any of the material, and aren't liable for what other sites on the internet may or may not host. That's the responsibility of the intellectual property holders to investigate that, not ours. The links that we're using, and processing, are arguably public domain as they're part of the internet, in terms of accessibility. However, in terms of ownership, each domain is registered to a specific owner that could in-part be held liable for the content contained therein (on said attached servers), that would be investigated by the aforementioned IP holder.

## If there's no monetization, how are you going to keep this up?
While we're against immediate monetization, there has be consideration to allow auxiliary monetization over certain parts of the intended platform, pending content type and execution therein. We also may allow for donations, or recurring donations, at a point.

## Will this damage IP holders?
In our opinion, no. We think it will actually help them. It should allow for older archived content to be served to a wider audience, garnering more favor towards ideal or favored companies, which will be mentioned and made notation of, almost akin to a free broad-spectrum advertising campaign.

By-extension, this should increase subscriptions or ratings on those platforms respectively, as a show of support towards the work and effort that has been seen thus far.
